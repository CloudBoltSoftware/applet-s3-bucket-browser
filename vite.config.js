/**
 * When building the vue library and keeping vue as an external dependency,
 * the import statements in the vue files are not resolved correctly. Specifically,
 * we attempt to import 'createElementVNode' from 'vue' but it is not found.
 * In vue3, that function is simply called 'h'.
 *
 * This is an absolutely terrible hack to fix the issue for now. There is some
 * subtle version mismatch, bug, or interplay between vite, vue, and rollup that
 * does this. It's only a problem when vue is external. ðŸ¤·
